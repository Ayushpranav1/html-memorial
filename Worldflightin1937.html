    <h2>World flight in 1937</h2>
    <p>Planning-
        In 1935, Earhart joined Purdue University as a visiting faculty member to counsel women on careers and as a technical advisor to its Department of Aeronautics. Early in 1936, Earhart started planning a round-the-world flight. Although others had flown around the world, her flight would be the longest at 29,000 miles (47,000 km) because it followed a roughly equatorial route. With financing from Purdue, in July 1936, a Lockheed Electra 10E (reg. NR16020) was built at Lockheed Aircraft Company to her specifications, which included extensive modifications to the fuselage to incorporate many additional fuel tanks.Earhart dubbed the twin engine monoplane her "flying laboratory".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart#World_flight_in_1937">Read more</a>
