    <h2>Speculation on disappearance</h2>
    <p>There has been considerable speculation on what happened to Earhart and Noonan. Most historians hold to the simple "crash and sink" theory, but a number of other possibilities have been proposed, including several conspiracy theories.

Proposals have included the uninhabited Gardner Island, 400 mi (640 km) from the vicinity of Howland, the Japanese-controlled Marshall Islands, 870 mi (1,400 km) at the closest point of Mili Atoll, and the Japanese-controlled Northern Mariana Islands, 2,700 mi (4,300 km) from Howland
